# <Advanced CSS: Portfolio>

## Description

I was really excited to create my own portfolio by scratch so I can come up with ideas for my own webpage, and practice more coding so I can start to remember what is needed and how to make it. I definitely had some ups and downs with this project. I feel like my weaknesses are flexbox, margins, padding, and a little bit of text-alighnment. I did very well with working on the colors of the page and the majority of html.

## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
